# Stock Trading App

## 📜 About
This app offers a simulated stock trading experience, enabling users to engage in trading activities without the risks associated with real capital.

### 🔜 Future Enhancements
- **Leaderboard Functionality**: A competitive feature to rank users based on their trading performance.
- **Enhanced Stock Details**: Inclusion of comprehensive stock information like market cap, moving averages, and more.
- **Deployment**: Once the aforementioned features are incorporated, the aim is to make the app publicly available for everyone to enjoy.

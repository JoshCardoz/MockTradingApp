## üìú About
This app offers a simulated stock trading experience, enabling users to engage in trading activities without the risks associated with real capital. One of the core inspirations behind this project was to introduce a gamified element to trading, allowing users to compete with friends and see who can grow their portfolio the most in a given timeframe.

### üîú Future Enhancements
- **Leaderboard Functionality**: A competitive feature to rank users based on their trading performance.
- **Enhanced Stock Details**: Inclusion of comprehensive stock information like market cap, moving averages, and more.
- **Deployment**: Once the mentioned features are incorporated, the aim is to make the app publicly available for everyone to enjoy.
